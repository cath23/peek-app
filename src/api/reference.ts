/**
 * Static reference data behind the seam.
 *
 * Two categories live here:
 *
 * 1. Third-party integration mocks (files, Figma frames, Linear issues).
 *    These stay static by design — they mock integrations that are a
 *    separate, later project (see PRDs/Peek-Domain-Model.md §6).
 *
 * 2. Presentation constants + non-reactive snapshots of app data
 *    (HIGHLIGHT_META, PEOPLE, TOPICS, avatarFor). The snapshots exist for
 *    consumers that cannot use hooks (Tiptap extensions, parsing helpers).
 *    Reactive consumers must use the seam hooks instead — a component that
 *    imports TOPICS from here will not see runtime-created topics (same
 *    behavior as today's direct mock imports).
